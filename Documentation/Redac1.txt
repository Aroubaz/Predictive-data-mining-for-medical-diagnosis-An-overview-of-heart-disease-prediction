The Algorithme in the document that was work with : 
1 - Naive Bayes K-NN 
2- Decision List algorithm 

this kind of algorithm above was using to analyzing the dataset


Now we will introduce the Tools that will work with it : 
Name : Tanagra , is used to classify the data and the data is eveluated by using
10-fold cross validation and the results are compared 

.it's a data mining suite build with a graphical interface.
 
.main puprpose of Tanagra is to give the main purpose to Reasearchers  and 
students a easy to use a data mining software 

Contain : 
 * clustering 
 * Data Visualization 
 * Supervised learning 
 * Meta supervised learning 
 * Feature selection and construction algorithms : 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  #### DECISION TREE ####### --> easy to Implement no domain knowledge 
                               --> Allows you to handle high dimensional data 
			       --> The Result is easy to read and interpret 
			       --> The drill through feature to access detailed patientsâ€Ÿ profiles is only available in
				   Decision Trees.	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* ##### Naive Bayes #########
   			     --> statistical classifier 
                             --> Assume no dependency between the attributes 
                             -->  It attempts to maximize the posterior probability in determining 
                             -->  Naive Bayes classifiers have works well in many complex real-world situations
 			     -->
