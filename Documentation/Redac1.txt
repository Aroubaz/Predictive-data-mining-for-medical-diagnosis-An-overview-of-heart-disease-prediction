The Algorithme in the document that was work with : 
1 - Naive Bayes K-NN 
2- Decision List algorithm 

this kind of algorithm above was using to analyzing the dataset


Now we will introduce the Tools that will work with it : 
Name : Tanagra , is used to classify the data and the data is eveluated by using
10-fold cross validation and the results are compared 

.it's a data mining suite build with a graphical interface.
 
.main puprpose of Tanagra is to give the main purpose to Reasearchers  and 
students a easy to use a data mining software 

Contain : 
 * clustering 
 * Data Visualization 
 * Supervised learning 
 * Meta supervised learning 
 * Feature selection and construction algorithms : 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  #### DECISION TREE ####### --> easy to Implement no domain knowledge 
                               --> Allows you to handle high dimensional data 
			       --> The Result is easy to read and interpret 
			       --> The drill through feature to access detailed patientsâ€Ÿ profiles is only available in
				   Decision Trees.	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* ##### Naive Bayes #########
   			     --> statistical classifier 
                             --> Assume no dependency between the attributes 
                             -->  It attempts to maximize the posterior probability in determining 
                             -->  Naive Bayes classifiers have works well in many complex real-world situations
 			     
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ###### K-NN #########
                            -->  is a method for classifying objects based on closest training data 
                            -->  The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is amongst the simplest of all machine learning algorithms
                            -->  accuracy of the k-NN algorithm can be severely degraded by the presence of noisy or irrelevant features
  		            --> or if the feature scales are not consistent with their importance
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HERE WE WILL SET SOME TEST DATA TO TEST ONE OF THE ALGORITHME A SAY WHY WE USE THIS KIND 
OF ALGORITHME 
_______________________________________________________________________________________

  (*) Algorithm that we will use is the Naive Bayes 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 before we use the data we almost have to normilze the data  
  to reduce data size to get the optimal subset of attributed sufficient for heart disease
  prediction. Classification is aa supervised learning method to extract models describing important
